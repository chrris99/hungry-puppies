# Unit test demo

The starter project contains some example unit tests both for the client application and some integration tests for the API.

To run the integration tests for the API, execute the `dotnet test` command in the `server` directory.

In this demo we are going to implement some unit tests for the newly implemented puppy feeding functionality that we've seen in the code generation demo.
